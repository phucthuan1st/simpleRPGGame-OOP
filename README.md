## About game:
### Target
This game is for who want to learn OOP. This project is a simple one that should be your class assignment.
I wanna develope it to a 2D version (with SDL), so I will do it in the future.

### How to play

### Libraries:
- [SLD2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- Windows.h (First build to test my classes)

### Future developement
So, as I mention abouve, I will build a 2D-version with SDL after I complete console-version (a simple version). My first sight is a pixel game that you can play on windows.
